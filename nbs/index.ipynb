    "**docstring-gen** is an easy-to-use Python library that uses <a href = \"https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/codex\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI's Codex model</a> to automatically generate <a href=\"https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html\" target = \"_blank\">Google-style docstrings</a> for Python codebase. The library is capable of reading both Jupyter notebooks and Python files, and seamlessly adds meaningful docstrings to classes and functions that lack documentation. By using **docstring-gen**, developers can automatically generate docstrings for their codebase, resulting in time savings and improved documentation quality."
